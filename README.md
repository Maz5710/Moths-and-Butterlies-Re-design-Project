## UX Design Assignment
The aim of this project was to practice the fundamentals of UX design, incorporating user feedback in the design in an iterative process to achieve the desired outcome. This project included advanced HTML and CSS, and introduction to JavaScript to create interactive effects.

## Project Overview
I choose to re-design the Moths and Butterflies Trust of New Zealand website. During the project the Trust released their updated website with new logo and significant changes to the content, some areas where similar to my re-design.

## UX Process
Through the UX research process the objectives of the re-design were to make the brand clear, increase revenue opportunities and consolidate the website content and re-order.
